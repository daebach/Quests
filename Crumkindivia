Here is a tasty world where the cany and the pastries are at war.

1. Go to oppressed pastry Ladyfinger and greet her. [Area 9890].

2. Kill all the peeps you can find and bring them to Ladyfinger so that
she can make batter. This may take two runs so you mand need to wait for
the peeps to reset.

3. When she has enough batter, seek the candy hidden around. Eat the
candy and see if you can get the artifacts of WHISK, SPOON AND COOKIE
CUTTER. The Licorice queen has the rolling pin but only three of the
items are needed. The queen is difficult to kill and teams with the
peeps to defend them as you may discover.

4. Candy is found:
.....a. sugar maple leaf [area 131] TOUCH LEAF
.....b. mint [area 9891] TOUCH CANDY
.....c. lemon drop [area 9892]
.....d. sugar reed [area 9886]

.....j. candy apple [area 9901] TOUCH APPPLE
.....k. lollypop [area 9905]
.....l. cotton candy butterfly [area 9904]
.....m. jelly bean [area 9908]

5. Take the whisk, spoon, cutter or rolling pin, (must be three of the
four) to Muffin man. [area 9882]. Gie them to him. He sill then give you
a note to take to Ladyfinger.

6. Take the note to Ladyfinger who will give you a magicla vial of
syrup. Make a note of the vial number in your inventory.

7. Give the vial to Muffin who will transform the doughboy.

hurts a bit though.
